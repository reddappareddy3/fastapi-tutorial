    "#### Core Principles of FastAPI\n",
    "##### 1.Performance First\n",
    "- FastAPI is built on Starlette (ASGI) and Pydantic, making it one of the fastest Python frameworks, comparable to Node.js and Go.\n",
    "##### 2.Type-Driven Development\n",
    "FastAPI uses Python type hints as the single source of truth for:\n",
    "- Validation\n",
    "- Serialization\n",
    "- Documentation\n",
    "##### 3.Automatic Validation & Safety\n",
    "- FastAPI validates request and response data before execution, reducing runtime errors.\n",
    "##### 4.Developer Experience (DX)\n",
    "Minimal boilerplate code with:\n",
    "- Auto-generated Swagger UI\n",
    "- Interactive API docs\n",
    "- Clear error messages\n",
    "##### 5. Async by Default\n",
    "- Designed for async/await, making it ideal for I/O-heavy and scalable applications.\n",
    "- async and await are used to write asynchronous, non-blocking code in Python.\n",
    "- They allow a program to handle multiple tasks concurrently without waiting for one task to finish before starting another.\n",
    "- In FastAPI, they improve performance and scalability, especially for I/O-bound operations like database calls or API requests.\n",
    "##### 6. Standards-Based Design\n",
    "FastAPI strictly follows:\n",
    "- OpenAPI\n",
    "- JSON Schema\n",
    "- ASGI\n",
    "##### 7.Readability & Maintainability\n",
    "- Code is clean, explicit, and self-documenting."

    "FastAPI works by combining an ASGI server, Starlette, and Pydantic to process requests efficiently and safely.\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Working of FastAPI\n",
    "##### 1.Client Sends Request\n",
    "- A client (browser / Postman / frontend) sends an HTTP request (GET, POST, etc.).\n",
    "##### 2.ASGI(Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) Server (Uvicorn) Receives Request\n",
    "Uvicorn acts as the ASGI server.\n",
    "- It receives the request\n",
    "- Passes it to the FastAPI application\n",
    "- Manages the event loop for async execution\n",
    "  - SGI\n",
    "    - SGI (WSGI or ASGI) acts as a bridge between the web server and the Python application.\n",
    "    - It converts an incoming HTTP request from the web server into a Python-understandable format, and converts the Python response back into an HTTP response for the client.\n",
    "##### 3.Routing via Starlette\n",
    "FastAPI uses Starlette’s routing system.\n",
    "- Matches URL path and HTTP method\n",
    "- Calls the corresponding path operation function\n",
    "##### 4.Dependency Injection\n",
    "FastAPI resolves dependencies before executing the function.\n",
    "- Auth checks\n",
    "- Database sessions\n",
    "- Request objects\n",
    "##### 5.Data Validation with Pydantic\n",
    "Request body, query params, and path params are:\n",
    "- Parsed\n",
    "- Validated\n",
    "- Converted to correct types\n",
    "- If validation fails → 422 error returned automatically\n",
    "##### 6.Function Execution\n",
    "- Sync or async function runs\n",
    "- If async → handled efficiently by event loop\n",
    "##### 7.Response Serialization\n",
    "- Response data is:\n",
    "- Converted to JSON\n",
    "- Validated (if response model is used)\n",
    "##### 8.Auto Documentation\n",
    "- FastAPI automatically updates:\n",
    "- Swagger UI (/docs)\n",
    "- OpenAPI schema\n",
    "#### 9.Response Sent to Client\n",
    "- Clean, validated JSON response returned\n",

    "## **Step-by-Step Flow Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Client Sends HTTP Request**\n",
    "\n",
    "A client (browser / Postman / frontend app) sends an HTTP request:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "POST /predict HTTP/1.1\n",
    "Host: api.example.com\n",

    "  \"feature2\": 3.1\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- This request is **pure HTTP**, not Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Web Server Receives Request**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **web server** (like Nginx or Uvicorn):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Receives the HTTP request\n",
    "* Does **not understand Python logic**\n",
    "* Passes the request to **SGI (WSGI/ASGI)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Web server’s job = handle network & HTTP.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. SGI (ASGI) Converts HTTP → Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **most important role of SGI**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **SGI converts the raw HTTP request into Python-understandable objects.**\n",
    "\n",
    "So this HTTP request becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "request.method = \"POST\"\n",
    "request.url = \"/predict\"\n",
    "request.json() = {\n",
    "    \"feature1\": 5.2,\n",
    "    \"feature2\": 3.1\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now Python code can work with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. API Code (FastAPI) Executes**\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI receives the Python request object and executes the endpoint:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.post(\"/predict\")\n",
    "def predict(data: InputData):\n",
    "    result = data.feature1 + data.feature2\n",
    "    return {\"prediction\": result}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "5.2 + 3.1 = 8.3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. API Returns Python Response**\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI returns a Python dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\"prediction\": 8.3}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But the client **cannot understand Python**, so…\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. SGI Converts Python → HTTP**\n",
    "\n",
    "SGI converts the Python response into an HTTP response:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n",
    "Content-Type: application/json\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"prediction\": 8.3\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Again, SGI acts as the **translator**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Web Server Sends Response to Client**\n",
